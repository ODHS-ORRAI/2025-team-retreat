    "text": "9:05 – Activity #3 – Creating OEDA Units\n\nPurpose\nIn this activity, we will explore whether grouping the OEDA actions from Activity #2 might suggest functional units within OEDA. Eventually, these functional units will be more than descriptive. If we identify units, we can create supports and clear expectations and processes for those units: dependencies and sources of inputs, standard operating procedures, checklists and templates, processes for handoffs, and so on.\nThis activity is our primary goal for the morning of Day 1.\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat are OEDA’s basic work units?\n\n\nActivity\n\nSilent, individual work (20 minutes)\n\nCreate one or more candidate units as a text box\nIn the text box, provide a high level summary of that unit’s basic job\nDrag and drop cards from Activity #2 into your text box\nIf you see a group someone else has started that you agree with, add a comment or emoji\nIf you see a group that you don’t agree with, you can create a different group (duplicating cards, if necessary, and making the duplication visually obvious by connecting duplicated cards)\nIf you develop questions or ideas that don’t directly relate to the activity, stick them in a parking lot\n\n\n\nAlignment and refinement (30 minutes)\n\nAlignment activity\n\nModified gallery walk through the visualized groups, one-by-one\nThe group creator, or anyone who contributed to the group, will explain the logic behind the grouping\n\nRefinement activity; interrogate the groups\n\nDoes the group contain every activity it needs to function? What activities are we missing for this group to be truly self-contained?\nWould it be reliant on management for daily work?\nWould it be heavily reliant on another group for daily work?\nCould a mini-team (even just one person) focused on these activities manage their own workload and work quality?\n\n\n\n\nFinalize the groups (10 minutes)\n\nConsider the results of refinement\nFist-to-five voting on whether each is good-enough-for-now\n\nGroups that receive only 3, 4, or 5 finger votes will be considered in later sessions during the retreat\nGroups that receive any 0, 1, or 2 finger votes will not be excluded from later sessions during the retreat\n\n\n\n\nName the groups (10 minutes)\n\nIndividuals spend a few minutes typing candidate names for any groups\nFist-to-five voting on whether names are good-enough-for-now\n\nName suggestions that receive only 3, 4, or 5 finger votes will be adopted; if there are more than on such for a group, we can have a majority vote\n\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nUnits should be autonomous.\nUnits should be responsible for a single product or class of deliverable. Deliverables can be internal or external.\nUnits should be able to be described with nouns labeling the unit, perhaps proper nouns naming the unit.\nIdeally, use each activity from Step 1 only once.\nOur focus this morning will likely be on standing units. With what we learn about System 1 units in OEDA, we might in the future also spin up ad hoc units for specific projects.\n\nWhat does it mean to be autonomous? When a unit has access to its necessary inputs–which are created outside the unit–they should be able to completely deliver their products using only combinations of the OEDA activities from Step 1. Autonomous units do not need constant direction for their core tasks. They are self-managing: the people in the unit can handle their day-to-day operations and problem-solving. Autonomous units have their own specific environments: a particular dataset, a particular deliverable, a particular set of stakeholders.\nHow many units could OEDA have? There is no preset floor or ceiling on the number of units. Strive to make OEDA’s work unit structure as simple as possible, but not simpler.\nWhat about staffing units? Do not worry yet about attaching positions or individuals to units. OEDA staff have cross-cutting skills and content expertise, so may end up participating in several functional units, perhaps even on the same project. The same functional unit may have different staff from project to project. This structure is reminiscent of fission-fusion societies. We will address this later.\nWhat if a function is needed for more than one unit? If you feel that you need to duplicate a function across more than one unit, first consider:\n\nMaking the function its own autonomous work unit, delivering products to other units.\nDuplicating the verb + object pair, but adding modifiers to add specificity and maintain uniqueness.\n\nIf these are not ideal, duplicate the function, but show the redundancy visually. Redundancy isn’t necessarily bad. It should just be created thoughtfully and transparently.\n\n\nDeliverable\nA first draft of the standing units in OEDA, each capable of taking inputs, engaging in specific activities to add value to those inputs, and delivering products to others, including other units."

    "text": "10:30 – Activity #4 – Identifying Unit Outputs\n\nPurpose\nFor the standing units which are the focus of this activity, each OEDA unit should create a relatively fixed set of unique and mutually understood outputs. When we are planning future OEDA projects and identify the need for a certain internal deliverable (dataset, analysis, copyedit, accessibility check, etc.) or a external deliverable (application, paper, slide deck, etc.), our team should know the unit or units that will need to be engaged.\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat do OEDA units produce from their activities?\n\n\nActivity\n\nSilent, individual work (10 minutes)\n\nAdd a green sticky note to the right hand border of the unit naming one of the outputs from that unit\nIf you see sticky notes from someone else that you agree with, add a comment or emoji\nIf you see a sticky that you don’t agree with, you can leave it and create an alternative sticky for that group\nIf you develop questions or ideas that don’t directly relate to the activity, stick them in a parking lot\n\n\n\nAlignment and refinement (30 minutes)\n\nAlignment activity\n\nModified gallery walk through the groups, one-by-one\nThe creator of the output will share about it, if necessary\n\nRefinement activity; interrogate the groups\n\nDoes the group contain every activity it needs to function?

The work of a COIN unit may be a precursor to many OEDA research briefs, but that unit might not routinely create research briefs as part of its core work. That team would not be connected to a research brief output, even though their work might be vital to those products.\nUsing modifiers. Many units might create research briefs, so we could conceivably identify research brief as an OEDA ouput and connect this back to several units: evaluation unit, performance measurement unit, etc. Alternatively, we could identify unique outputs and connect each of these to single units: evaluation brief, measurement brief, hypothesis test brief, etc.\nI believe this latter approach will be much more helpful when we work to build OEDA’s System 2. System 2 includes supports and procedures for the autonomy and efficiency of System 1 units. When we create checklists, rubrics, templates, boilerplate language, and so on in our System 2, these will be more useful for something specific, like evaluation brief, than for a generic research brief.\nAdding specificity might also help us identify specific outputs that are missing at this point in the retreat, which we may need to assign to a unit, or even create a future unit to handle.\n\n\nDeliverable\nA menu of OEDA outputs with direct links to the units responsible for those outputs."

Primary Level 1 units produce their outputs primarily for audiences outside of OEDA: advisory committee members, program and agency leaders, etc. Support units provide their outputs primarily for other OEDA units. This will help us create process maps for OEDA, highlighting\nMore importantly, taking a few moments to identify the audiences and stakeholders for our slate of OEDA units allows us to take stock of those audiences, and interrogate that array. When we look across the audiences, who is missing? Does missingness suggest outputs missing from our repertoire? Do missing audiences suggest missing work units we need to consider in the future?

This serves three primary goals\n\nTo solidify the boundaries of each System 1 unit be clearly defining its starting point\nTo create a concrete checklist of inputs that must be in place before work can be handed off to that unit, increasing transparency and predictability\nTo surface dependencies, bottlenecks, and potential resource conflicts that will provide the raw material for designing our System 2 (Coordination) functions in a later session\n\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat are the “starting blocks” for each unit? Think of this as mise en place for a recipe–you can’t start cooking efficiently until you have all the ingredients measured out on the counter. For each System 1 unit, what are the absolutely essential inputs, permissions, resources, and pieces of information that MUST be in place before that unit can begin its autonomous work?\nTry to be specific about what the unit might need. Broad classes of inputs might include things like Permissions & Access, Data & Information, or Scope & Direction.\n\n\nActivity\nOn a whiteboard populated with our candidate System 1 unit\n\nSilent, individual work (10 minutes)\n\nAdd orange sticky notes to any unit you like, representing necessary inputs to that unit.\nGenerate as many as you can without discussion or judgment.\nIf you see sticky notes from others that you agree with, add a comment or emoji.\n\n\n\nGroup discussion and refinement (25 minutes)\n\nMove through the whiteboard, unit-by-unit, discussing each input\nClarify: Is this truly a prerequsite, or is it something created or acquired during the unit’s work? We’ll remove anything that isn’t a true input.\nCluster: If sticky notes within a unit are similar, group them and consider a single label.\nRefine: Edit the language on the stickies to meet constraints and improve clarity.\n\n\n\nCross-system patterns (20 minutes)\n\nLook for patterns across the different units\nMark with a star any input that is required by more than one System 1 unit. These highlight a potential resource conflict or coordination need.\nMark with a red flag any input that the team agrees current has an unknown process, or is difficult, slow, or unreliable to obtain. This highlights known pain points.\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nEach orange sticky note must be a tangible noun; it should be a noun or noun phrase, not a verb or process. What is the thing that the unit needs to have in hand before it can begin work?\nThe input must be a true prerequisite. If acquiring the item is part of the System 1 unit’s core work, it is not an input.\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nA more detailed process map of OEDA, highlighting some process dependencies. This will include an early list of starred and flagged inputs which might represent shared resources (and thus potential conflicts) or known bottlenecks.

We are confident in their basic processes and could support their needs. We feel comfortable presenting these to the OEDA Advisory Committee as a core service today or in the very near future.\nNext: These are high-priority units that–because of their outputs, audience, etc.–are crucial to our mission, but which need significant work. This may be securing inputs, refining processes, or dedicating resources.

This suggests a high degree of independence, accountability, and responsibility across all phases of research design, conduct, and delivery.\nMy hope is that formal modeling the work of a research team will help us identify:\n\nWhat we can do on our own in OEDA\nWhat we need to ask of others to make our work possible: data experts, research peers in other agencies, ORRAI leadership, agency leaders\nHow we can better manage our processes, formally and informally\nRoles and responsibilities across OEDA positions\n\nOf these, #2 and #3 are key for this retreat. The second may yield a series of briefings or a list of requests to Peter, the nascent OEDA Advisory Committee, or others so that OEDA has the System 2, 4, and 5 supports that it needs. The third will be work assigned to Jason and others to create the System 2 processes that allow System 1 activities to proceed autonomously and with solid cooperation, communication, and collaboration with other groups.\nI want to create a system that supports you, so that OEDA research can be done sustainably and viably. Ultimately, I hope that our time during this retreat will contribute to OEDA producing things of value to people who will champion and provision our work in a virtuous cycle of mutual support."

We are going to step back and look at our team not as a group of researchers, but as a system. A system with needs, working within and alongside other systems.\nWe will plan for a future working with an OEDA Advisory Committee and restarting our legislative mandate for the integration and analysis of cross-agency client and customer service data.\nUsing Beer’s Viable System Model, we will map out how we might operate, stay stable, set our direction, and adapt.\nI will be asking you to think about OEDA as a formalized and structured system. This may feel constraining for research professionals used to shepherding projects with a lot of variation from project to project, a lot of latitude, creativity, individualization, and autonomy.\nYour work should be highly autonomous.
