This may help create a shared standard of quality and a common language for describing the things we create.\n\n\nPrompt\nImagine a key stakeholder–a legislator, an agency head, a program manager–or one of your OEDA peers has just finished reading one of your reports or using one of your tools. They turn to a colleague and say “This work is so ____”. What adjectives would we want them to use?\n\n\nActivity\n\nSilent Individual Brainstorming (5 minutes)\nTeam members silently add sticky notes with single adjectives to the Qualities of What We Create whiteboard. It’s a brainstorm: strive for quantity over quality!\n\n\nAlignment & refinement (15 minutes)\nWe will consider each adjective, one at a time. For each, we will determine whether it should sit next to an adjective that we’ve already considered, or should (for now) sit alone. We may have to split and regroup as we go!\n\n\nLabeling (5 minutes)\nFor each group of adjectives, assign a good-enough-for-now label that reflects the theme of that group.\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nEach sticky note should be an adjective or short adjectival phrase (e.g. “data-rich”)\nFocus on the artifact. Each sticky should be something that could describe a product, deliverable, or output; processes and working relationships are the next activity\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nA set of (perhaps 3-5) core themes, each supported by a cluster of descriptive adjectives, that define OEDA’s shared vision for the qualities of its products."

We will move beyond our outputs to outcomes: change for agency processes and policies, change for Oregonian’s experiences, and so on. These impacts can help form the core of OEDA’s purpose.\n\n\nPrompt\nWe’ve defined the qualities of our work and of our process. Here, we ask the most important question: So what? If we do all this high-quality, collaborative work, what will change in the world? What impact will it have? Months and years down the road, how would we complete the sentence: “Because of our work…”?\n\n\nActivity\n\nGroup brainstorm & discussion (25 minutes)\n\nWhat decisions will be better informed?\nWhose lives will be improved?\nWhat state systems will become more efficient? More effective? More equitable?\nWhat conversations will be started that weren’t happening before?\n\nWe can use the OEDA Impacts whiteboard.\n\n\nConstraints\n\nFocus on external change. Our statements should describe effects outside of our team: in policy, operations, public understanding, etc.\nConsider using active verbs, framing impacts as actions or changes. E.g. rather than “Better information for policy makers” maybe something like “Policy makers make evidence-based budget decisions.”\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nThis activity is not setting an agenda. We will return to potential impacts many times in the future.

Let’s connect our how and our why.\n\n\nActivity\nWe will create a table with three columns and several rows. Cells in the leftmost column will contain one or more qualities. Qualities can be repeated in different rows. Cells in the rightmost column will contain one or more impacts.\nIn the middle, we will identify the mechanism(s) through which those values can help bring about the impacts we want to see.\nFor instance, if one of our product qualities relates to ease of understanding and highlighting key takeaways, and one of our impacts is “program managers can use our evidence to adapt their daily practices and improve services”, the how in the middle column might be “because we translate complex statistical findings into accessible language and visuals, allowing non-technical audiences to grasp the core message and its implications for their work.”\n\n\nGroup mapping & discussion (25 minutes)\nFor each quality, we will ask\n\n“Which of our desired impacts does this quality help us achieve?”\n“And how does it do that?” Don’t get caught up in wordsmithing at this point. Simple sketches of ideas are fine.\n\nI’ve created a simple Word document to house this activity.\n\n\nConstraints\n\nEach connection between value(s) and impact should (eventually) be explainable and clear. If the link is weak, we shouldn’t force it today.\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nA values-to-impact map. This is the first draft of a visual artifact that demonstrates how OEDA’s daily values contribute to our ultimate purpose. This map can help drive high-level value statements, but could also be the seed of practical tools, like a rubric for evaluating which proposals become part of our portfolio.\n\n\n\n4:40 – End for the day\nA very long Day 1 is done!"

While System 1 is defined at the level of units, and not activities or processes, one route to defining units is to consider the typical work of an organization and then group those activities into functional units. That is what we will be trying to do.\nIn this pre-work activity, we will list the activities that the OEDA team, currently constituted, can or could engage in to bring value to cross-agency stakeholders.\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat are OEDA’s core value-creating activities? What could those be in OEDA’s future? What should they be?\n\n\nBackground material\nSystem 1 activities should fit within the DAS classification for OEDA positions.

You could freely add one to your card; you might add a note to someone else’s card for them to consider a modifer. E.g. rather than a card for “analyze data”, you might distinguish between “analyze survey data”, “analyze evaluation data”, “analyze interview data”, or “analyze economic data.”\n\n\nDeliverable\nA list of activities that OEDA staff or teams of staff can perform independently, are within the scope of DAS classifications for RA3, ECON3, and ISS7 positions, and which create value for stakeholders."

    "text": "9:05 – Activity #3 – Creating OEDA Units\n\nPurpose\nIn this activity, we will explore whether grouping the OEDA actions from Activity #2 might suggest functional units within OEDA. Eventually, these functional units will be more than descriptive. If we identify units, we can create supports and clear expectations and processes for those units: dependencies and sources of inputs, standard operating procedures, checklists and templates, processes for handoffs, and so on.\nThis activity is our primary goal for the morning of Day 1.\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat are OEDA’s basic work units?\n\n\nActivity\n\nSilent, individual work (20 minutes)\n\nCreate one or more candidate units as a text box\nIn the text box, provide a high level summary of that unit’s basic job\nDrag and drop cards from Activity #2 into your text box\nIf you see a group someone else has started that you agree with, add a comment or emoji\nIf you see a group that you don’t agree with, you can create a different group (duplicating cards, if necessary, and making the duplication visually obvious by connecting duplicated cards)\nIf you develop questions or ideas that don’t directly relate to the activity, stick them in a parking lot\n\n\n\nAlignment and refinement (30 minutes)\n\nAlignment activity\n\nModified gallery walk through the visualized groups, one-by-one\nThe group creator, or anyone who contributed to the group, will explain the logic behind the grouping\n\nRefinement activity; interrogate the groups\n\nDoes the group contain every activity it needs to function? What activities are we missing for this group to be truly self-contained?\nWould it be reliant on management for daily work?\nWould it be heavily reliant on another group for daily work?\nCould a mini-team (even just one person) focused on these activities manage their own workload and work quality?\n\n\n\n\nFinalize the groups (10 minutes)\n\nConsider the results of refinement\nFist-to-five voting on whether each is good-enough-for-now\n\nGroups that receive only 3, 4, or 5 finger votes will be considered in later sessions during the retreat\nGroups that receive any 0, 1, or 2 finger votes will not be excluded from later sessions during the retreat\n\n\n\n\nName the groups (10 minutes)\n\nIndividuals spend a few minutes typing candidate names for any groups\nFist-to-five voting on whether names are good-enough-for-now\n\nName suggestions that receive only 3, 4, or 5 finger votes will be adopted; if there are more than on such for a group, we can have a majority vote\n\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nUnits should be autonomous.\nUnits should be responsible for a single product or class of deliverable. Deliverables can be internal or external.\nUnits should be able to be described with nouns labeling the unit, perhaps proper nouns naming the unit.\nIdeally, use each activity from Step 1 only once.\nOur focus this morning will likely be on standing units. With what we learn about System 1 units in OEDA, we might in the future also spin up ad hoc units for specific projects.\n\nWhat does it mean to be autonomous? When a unit has access to its necessary inputs–which are created outside the unit–they should be able to completely deliver their products using only combinations of the OEDA activities from Step 1. Autonomous units do not need constant direction for their core tasks. They are self-managing: the people in the unit can handle their day-to-day operations and problem-solving. Autonomous units have their own specific environments: a particular dataset, a particular deliverable, a particular set of stakeholders.\nHow many units could OEDA have? There is no preset floor or ceiling on the number of units. Strive to make OEDA’s work unit structure as simple as possible, but not simpler.\nWhat about staffing units? Do not worry yet about attaching positions or individuals to units. OEDA staff have cross-cutting skills and content expertise, so may end up participating in several functional units, perhaps even on the same project. The same functional unit may have different staff from project to project. This structure is reminiscent of fission-fusion societies.\nWhat if a function is needed for more than one unit? If you feel that you need to duplicate a function across more than one unit, first consider:\n\nMaking the function its own autonomous work unit, delivering products to other units.\nDuplicating the verb + object pair, but adding modifiers to add specificity and maintain uniqueness.\n\nIf these are not ideal, duplicate the function, but show the redundancy visually. Redundancy isn’t necessarily bad. It should just be created thoughtfully and transparently.\n\n\nDeliverable\nA first draft of the standing units in OEDA, each capable of taking inputs, engaging in specific activities to add value to those inputs, and delivering products to others, including other units."

    "text": "10:30 – Activity #4 – Identifying Unit Outputs\n\nPurpose\nFor the standing units which are the focus of this activity, each OEDA unit should create a relatively fixed set of unique and mutually understood outputs. When we are planning future OEDA projects and identify the need for a certain internal deliverable (dataset, analysis, copyedit, accessibility check, etc.) or a external deliverable (application, paper, slide deck, etc.), our team should know the unit or units that will need to be engaged.\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat do OEDA units produce from their activities?\n\n\nActivity\n\nSilent, individual work (10 minutes)\n\nAdd a green sticky note to the right hand border of the unit naming one of the outputs from that unit\nIf you see sticky notes from someone else that you agree with, add a comment or emoji\nIf you see a sticky that you don’t agree with, you can leave it and create an alternative sticky for that group\nIf you develop questions or ideas that don’t directly relate to the activity, stick them in a parking lot\n\n\n\nAlignment and refinement (30 minutes)\n\nAlignment activity\n\nModified gallery walk through the groups, one-by-one\nThe creator of the output will share about it, if necessary\n\nRefinement activity; interrogate the groups\n\nDoes the group contain every activity it needs to function?

The work of a COIN unit may be a precursor to many OEDA research briefs, but that unit might not routinely create research briefs as part of its core work. That team would not be connected to a research brief output, even though their work might be vital to those products.\nUsing modifiers. Many units might create research briefs, so we could conceivably identify research brief as an OEDA ouput and connect this back to several units: evaluation unit, performance measurement unit, etc. Alternatively, we could identify unique outputs and connect each of these to single units: evaluation brief, measurement brief, hypothesis test brief, etc.\nI believe this latter approach will be much more helpful when we work to build OEDA’s System 2. System 2 includes supports and procedures for the autonomy and efficiency of System 1 units. When we create checklists, rubrics, templates, boilerplate language, and so on in our System 2, these will be more useful for something specific, like evaluation brief, than for a generic research brief.\nAdding specificity might also help us identify specific outputs that are missing at this point in the retreat, which we may need to assign to a unit, or even create a future unit to handle.\n\n\nDeliverable\nA menu of OEDA outputs with direct links to the units responsible for those outputs."

Primary Level 1 units produce their outputs primarily for audiences outside of OEDA: advisory committee members, program and agency leaders, etc. Support units provide their outputs primarily for other OEDA units. This will help us create process maps for OEDA, highlighting\nMore importantly, taking a few moments to identify the audiences and stakeholders for our slate of OEDA units allows us to take stock of those audiences, and interrogate that array. When we look across the audiences, who is missing? Does missingness suggest outputs missing from our repertoire? Do missing audiences suggest missing work units we need to consider in the future? Identifying these can help set the strategic direction for OEDA’s future development.\n\n\nPrompt\nWho consumes work from this unit?

This serves three primary goals\n\nTo solidify the boundaries of each System 1 unit be clearly defining its starting point\nTo create a concrete checklist of inputs that must be in place before work can be handed off to that unit, increasing transparency and predictability\nTo surface dependencies, bottlenecks, and potential resource conflicts that will provide the raw material for designing our System 2 (Coordination) functions in a later session\n\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat are the “starting blocks” for each unit? Think of this as mise en place for a recipe–you can’t start cooking efficiently until you have all the ingredients measured out on the counter. For each System 1 unit, what are the absolutely essential inputs, permissions, resources, and pieces of information that MUST be in place before that unit can begin its autonomous work?\nTry to be specific about what the unit might need. Broad classes of inputs might include things like Permissions & Access, Data & Information, or Scope & Direction.\n\n\nActivity\nOn a whiteboard populated with our candidate System 1 unit\n\nSilent, individual work (10 minutes)\n\nAdd orange sticky notes to any unit you like, representing necessary inputs to that unit.\nGenerate as many as you can without discussion or judgment.\nIf you see sticky notes from others that you agree with, add a comment or emoji.\n\n\n\nGroup discussion and refinement (25 minutes)\n\nMove through the whiteboard, unit-by-unit, discussing each input\nClarify: Is this truly a prerequsite, or is it something created or acquired during the unit’s work? We’ll remove anything that isn’t a true input.\nCluster: If sticky notes within a unit are similar, group them and consider a single label.\nRefine: Edit the language on the stickies to meet constraints and improve clarity.\n\n\n\nCross-system patterns (20 minutes)\n\nLook for patterns across the different units\nMark with a star any input that is required by more than one System 1 unit. These highlight a potential resource conflict or coordination need.\nMark with a red flame any input that the team agrees current has an unknown process, or is difficult, slow, or unreliable to obtain. This highlights known pain points and bottlenecks.\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nEach orange sticky note must be a tangible noun; it should be a noun or noun phrase, not a verb or process. What is the thing that the unit needs to have in hand before it can begin work?\nThe input must be a true prerequisite. If acquiring the item is part of the System 1 unit’s core work, it is not an input.\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nA more detailed process map of OEDA, highlighting some process dependencies. This will include an early list of flagged inputs which might represent shared resources (and thus potential conflicts) or known bottlenecks.

This will create a strategic roadmap that clarifies our immediate priorities, manages team workload, and provides a clear, defensible plan to present to our nascent advisory committee. It helps us distinguish between what in OEDA might be operational today versus what is aspirational for the future, near or distant.\n\n\nPrompt\nWe may not be able to formalize and build the support systems for all of our System 1 units at once. We need to prioritize, considering both importance and readiness. Can we sort our System 1 units into three categories: Now, Next, and Later?\n\nNow: These units are the most ready to go. We are confident in their basic processes and could support their needs. We feel comfortable presenting these to the OEDA Advisory Committee as a core service today or in the very near future.\nNext: These are high-priority units that–because of their outputs, audience, etc.–are crucial to our mission, but which need significant work. This may be securing inputs, refining processes, or dedicating resources. These are what we need to focus OEDA’s development efforts on in the near term.\nLater: These are units that are either less critical to our immediate strategic goals or require a great deal of work before they can be started.\n\n\n\nActivity\n\nGroup placement & discussion (20 minutes)\n\nDraw a 2 x 2 matrix on a whiteboard\nX axis: Readiness (“Needs significant work” to “Ready today”)\nY axis: Importance (“Lower strategic value” to “High strategic value”)\nCopy over the candidate unit sticky notes\n\nAs a group, we will interrogate each candidate OEDA unit\n\nConsidering this unit’s a) outputs and b) audiences, how high is its strategic importance to our teams core mission? The group’s rough consensus will determine the vertical position of the sticky note on the plane.\nConsidering the a) inputs we identified today and b) the state or need of standard operating procedures and other supports, how ready are we to operate this unit effectively today? Again, rough consensus will determine the horizontal position for the sticky note.\n\n\n\nDefine the zones (10 minutes)\nOnce the units are placed in the matrix, we will assign labels: Now, Next, Later\nIt could be that anything with high readiness is Now, and the other two quadrants become Next and Later based on their importance.\nOr it could be that anything with low importance is Later, and the other two quadrants are Next and Later based on their readiness."

Which one still feels most ambiguous or challenging to picture in practice?\nWe applied aspects of a very formal model-the Viable System Model–to our work, which is often creative, fluid, and conducted by a sole practitioner. What part of using that structured approach felt the most helpful or eye opening? What part felt the most awkward or difficult?\nWhen we discussed the inputs to or outputs from our work, what was the most surprising dependency or connection we uncoverwed that maybe we hadn’t explicitly acknowledged before?\nWhile there has been variation in ORRAI projects, it’s not uncommon for work to have been a “one-person-show” from start to finish. What are the biggest opportunities you see in a model of potential distinct units with clear hand-offs? What are the biggest risks or potential downsides we need to be mindful of as we go forward?\nFor our work to be truly autonomous in these units, we need to trust one another’s outputs. What needs to be true for you to feel confident in accepting a hand-off from another unit without feeling the need to re-do the work yourself?”\nWhat’s the most interesting part about formalizing our work this way? What’s the most intimidating or concening part?\nOn a process level, how is this retreat format working? Is the pattern of individual brainstorming followed by group discussion and alignment feeling productive and inclusive for you?\nIs there one thing we could tweak in how things are being facilitated or how we work together to make today’s session even more effective?\nThinking about the friction points and dependencies that we hinted at in Day 1, what’s the single biggest coordination problem you’re hoping we can discuss the need for, or even start designing a solution for, today?\n\n\n\nActivity\nEach team member selects one of the bullets above and shares briefly their response to the question or topic.\nIf we have time after everyone has done one, others can then react to their teammates’ contributions, or can contribute new responses to other bullets."

    "text": "8:30 - Activity #1 - Where’s the friction?\n\nPurpose\nTo identify and visualize the current and potential points of conflict, delay, and miscommunication between the team’s work units, as well as with external partners. We are trying to create an alignment, a shared understanding, of the problems that our future System 2 should work to solve.\n\n\nPrompt\nLook at the Now and Next work units we defined on Day 1. Think about the general flow of work from initial idea or request, through the hands of one or more of our units, to a final product for a stakeholder. Where does the process get stuck? Where do units compete for resources? We will try to map out the grit and friction in our emerging system.\n\n\nActivity\n\nSetup (5 minutes)\nOn a whiteboard, we will draw a simplified workflow: intake & scoping, data acquisition & prep, analysis & modeling, reporting & visualization, review & delivery. Perhaps additional stages like consultation, outreach & evangelism, etc.\nPlace each of the Now and Next System 1 units into the stage(s) where they will primarily operate. (Consider: If a unit crosses several stages, does it need to? Would it be helpful to conceive of it as separate units, or narrow its scope and assign some work to another existing unit?)\n\n\nSilent brainstorming (10 minutes)\nTeam members use red sticky notes to place “friction points” on the map. They should place the near the stage and/or near the unit where the friction occurs.\n\n\nGroup discussion & theming (45 minutes)\nWalk through the map, stage by stage. As a group, discuss the red sticky notes, and cluster together similar issues within the same stage.\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nProblems, not solutions: Each red sticky should describe a specific observed or anticipated problem or point of fiction, not a solution. A problem is something like “We don’t have a single source for past research projects.” A solution (still to come!) is something like “We need a knowledge base.”\nFocus on interactions: The friction points should primarily be about the hand-offs and interactions between units or between the team and the outside world.\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nA “fiction map” that visually represents the known and anticipated bottlenecks and pain points in OEDA’s workflows. These may be clustered into defined clusters."

Here, we are proposing solutions. For each of the major clusters of friction points, what specific, tangible thing could we create to solve it?

Instead, we will list them, and later this morning will assign out work to begin creating them.\nIf we still have time after addressing any major clusters we identified during Activity #1, we can turn to other individual friction points.\n\nSilent brainstorming (20 minutes)\nBrainstorm as many concrete solutions as possible. Create each solution as a blue sticky-note and attach it to a cluster or to an individual red sticky-not friction point. Focus on quantity and variety over quality. We will later be selective in which we might pursue."
