    "text": "Prework for Day 1, Activity #2 – Brainstorming OEDA Actions\n\nPurpose\nOEDA does not have defined System 1 units, defaulting instead to individual employees and individual projects. While System 1 is defined at the level of units, and not activities or processes, one route to defining units is to consider the typical work of an organization and then group those activities into functional units. That is what we will be trying to do.\nIn this pre-work activity, we will list the activities that the OEDA team, currently constituted, can or could engage in to bring value to cross-agency stakeholders.\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat are OEDA’s core value-creating activities? What could those be in OEDA’s future? What should they be?\n\n\nBackground material\nSystem 1 activities should fit within the DAS classification for OEDA positions. I have provided some background on OEDA position types to help with this alignment as you brainstorm.\n\n\nPre-work activity\nPopulate a whiteboard with post-it notes reflecting the value-creating activities of OEDA, those in which our staff receive some input and act on it, adding value which is ultimately realized in a deliverable to a stakeholder.\n\nOpen the Prework - OEDA Actions whiteboard\nFind the area labeled with your name\nAdd multiple yellow sticky-notes, one for each action you brainstorm\nSticky notes should satisfy the constraints listed below\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nEach card should be a transitive verb and a direct object\n\nThe direct object should relate either to\n\nThe inputs to the activity (e.g. analyze data)\nOr to the outputs from the activity (e.g. create a slide deck)\n\n\nEach card should be unique, appearing just once across the entire whiteboard (your section and those of everyone else)\nInclude activities that contribute to products; don’t include HR training, Workday entry, etc.\nActivities should represent the breadth OEDA positions, based on their general classifications\nInclude activities only for positions managed by the OEDA manager; exclude OEDA management, ORRAI leadership, and the data warehouse and reporting positions that OEDA funds\n\nTo keep cards unique, you might consider including a modifier/adjective to add specificity to the object. You could freely add one to your card; you might add a note to someone else’s card for them to consider a modifer. E.g. rather than a card for “analyze data”, you might distinguish between “analyze survey data”, “analyze evaluation data”, “analyze interview data”, or “analyze economic data.”\n\n\nDeliverable\nA list of activities that OEDA staff or teams of staff can perform independently, are within the scope of DAS classifications for RA3, ECON3, and ISS7 positions, and which create value for stakeholders."

    "text": "9:05 – Activity #3 – Creating OEDA Units\n\nPurpose\nIn this activity, we will explore whether grouping the OEDA actions from Activity #2 might suggest functional units within OEDA. Eventually, these functional units will be more than descriptive. If we identify units, we can create supports and clear expectations and processes for those units: dependencies and sources of inputs, standard operating procedures, checklists and templates, processes for handoffs, and so on.\nThis activity is our primary goal for the morning of Day 1.\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat are OEDA’s basic work units?\n\n\nActivity\n\nSilent, individual work (20 minutes)\n\nCreate one or more candidate units as a text box\nIn the text box, provide a high level summary of that unit’s basic job\nDrag and drop cards from Activity #2 into your text box\nIf you see a group someone else has started that you agree with, add a comment or emoji\nIf you see a group that you don’t agree with, you can create a different group (duplicating cards, if necessary, and making the duplication visually obvious by connecting duplicated cards)\nIf you develop questions or ideas that don’t directly relate to the activity, stick them in a parking lot\n\n\n\nAlignment and refinement (30 minutes)\n\nAlignment activity\n\nModified gallery walk through the visualized groups, one-by-one\nThe group creator, or anyone who contributed to the group, will explain the logic behind the grouping\n\nRefinement activity; interrogate the groups\n\nDoes the group contain every activity it needs to function? What activities are we missing for this group to be truly self-contained?\nWould it be reliant on management for daily work?\nWould it be heavily reliant on another group for daily work?\nCould a mini-team (even just one person) focused on these activities manage their own workload and work quality?\n\n\n\n\nFinalize the groups (10 minutes)\n\nConsider the results of refinement\nFist-to-five voting on whether each is good-enough-for-now\n\nGroups that receive only 3, 4, or 5 finger votes will be considered in later sessions during the retreat\nGroups that receive any 0, 1, or 2 finger votes will not be excluded from later sessions during the retreat\n\n\n\n\nName the groups (10 minutes)\n\nIndividuals spend a few minutes typing candidate names for any groups\nFist-to-five voting on whether names are good-enough-for-now\n\nName suggestions that receive only 3, 4, or 5 finger votes will be adopted; if there are more than on such for a group, we can have a majority vote\n\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nUnits should be autonomous.\nUnits should be responsible for a single product or class of deliverable. Deliverables can be internal or external.\nUnits should be able to be described with nouns labeling the unit, perhaps proper nouns naming the unit.\nIdeally, use each activity from Step 1 only once.\nOur focus this morning will likely be on standing units. With what we learn about System 1 units in OEDA, we might in the future also spin up ad hoc units for specific projects.\n\nWhat does it mean to be autonomous? When a unit has access to its necessary inputs–which are created outside the unit–they should be able to completely deliver their products using only combinations of the OEDA activities from Step 1. Autonomous units do not need constant direction for their core tasks. They are self-managing: the people in the unit can handle their day-to-day operations and problem-solving. Autonomous units have their own specific environments: a particular dataset, a particular deliverable, a particular set of stakeholders.\nHow many units could OEDA have? There is no preset floor or ceiling on the number of units. Strive to make OEDA’s work unit structure as simple as possible, but not simpler.\nWhat about staffing units? Do not worry yet about attaching positions or individuals to units. OEDA staff have cross-cutting skills and content expertise, so may end up participating in several functional units, perhaps even on the same project. The same functional unit may have different staff from project to project. This structure is reminiscent of fission-fusion societies.\nWhat if a function is needed for more than one unit? If you feel that you need to duplicate a function across more than one unit, first consider:\n\nMaking the function its own autonomous work unit, delivering products to other units.\nDuplicating the verb + object pair, but adding modifiers to add specificity and maintain uniqueness.\n\nIf these are not ideal, duplicate the function, but show the redundancy visually. Redundancy isn’t necessarily bad. It should just be created thoughtfully and transparently.\n\n\nDeliverable\nA first draft of the standing units in OEDA, each capable of taking inputs, engaging in specific activities to add value to those inputs, and delivering products to others, including other units."

    "text": "10:30 – Activity #4 – Identifying Unit Outputs\n\nPurpose\nFor the standing units which are the focus of this activity, each OEDA unit should create a relatively fixed set of unique and mutually understood outputs. When we are planning future OEDA projects and identify the need for a certain internal deliverable (dataset, analysis, copyedit, accessibility check, etc.) or a external deliverable (application, paper, slide deck, etc.), our team should know the unit or units that will need to be engaged.\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat do OEDA units produce from their activities?\n\n\nActivity\n\nSilent, individual work (10 minutes)\n\nAdd a green sticky note to the right hand border of the unit naming one of the outputs from that unit\nIf you see sticky notes from someone else that you agree with, add a comment or emoji\nIf you see a sticky that you don’t agree with, you can leave it and create an alternative sticky for that group\nIf you develop questions or ideas that don’t directly relate to the activity, stick them in a parking lot\n\n\n\nAlignment and refinement (30 minutes)\n\nAlignment activity\n\nModified gallery walk through the groups, one-by-one\nThe creator of the output will share about it, if necessary\n\nRefinement activity; interrogate the groups\n\nDoes the group contain every activity it needs to function? What activities are we missing for this group to be truly self-contained?\nWould it be reliant on management for daily work?\nWould it be heavily reliant on another group for daily work?\nCould a mini-team (even just one person) focused on these activities manage their own workload and work quality?\n\n\n\n\nFinalize the outputs (10 minutes)\n\nConsider the results of refinement\nFist-to-five voting on whether each is good-enough-for-now\n\nOutputs that receive only 3, 4, or 5 finger votes will be adopted as good-enough-for-now output classes for the group and may be considered in later activities during the retreat\nGroups that receive any 0, 1, or 2 finger votes will be tabled for discussion after the retreat\n\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nOutputs should be nouns or noun phrases naming concrete products, not verbs naming activities or processes\nEvery unit should have one or more outputs\nOutputs should be unique, not repeated across multiple units; consider adding modifiers to maintain distinctness\nOnly connect a unit to an output if the unit is primarily responsible for the finished output\n\nAccountable units. The work of a COIN unit may be a precursor to many OEDA research briefs, but that unit might not routinely create research briefs as part of its core work. That team would not be connected to a research brief output, even though their work might be vital to those products.\nUsing modifiers. Many units might create research briefs, so we could conceivably identify research brief as an OEDA ouput and connect this back to several units: evaluation unit, performance measurement unit, etc. Alternatively, we could identify unique outputs and connect each of these to single units: evaluation brief, measurement brief, hypothesis test brief, etc.\nI believe this latter approach will be much more helpful when we work to build OEDA’s System 2. System 2 includes supports and procedures for the autonomy and efficiency of System 1 units. When we create checklists, rubrics, templates, boilerplate language, and so on in our System 2, these will be more useful for something specific, like evaluation brief, than for a generic research brief.\nAdding specificity might also help us identify specific outputs that are missing at this point in the retreat, which we may need to assign to a unit, or even create a future unit to handle.\n\n\nDeliverable\nA menu of OEDA outputs with direct links to the units responsible for those outputs."

Primary Level 1 units produce their outputs primarily for audiences outside of OEDA: advisory committee members, program and agency leaders, etc. Support units provide their outputs primarily for other OEDA units. This will help us create process maps for OEDA, highlighting\nMore importantly, taking a few moments to identify the audiences and stakeholders for our slate of OEDA units allows us to take stock of those audiences, and interrogate that array. When we look across the audiences, who is missing? Does missingness suggest outputs missing from our repertoire? Do missing audiences suggest missing work units we need to consider in the future? Identifying these can help set the strategic direction for OEDA’s future development.\n\n\nPrompt\nWho consumes work from this unit? Whose work depends on the timely completion of this unit’s work?\n\n\nActivity\nLink each candidate unit, or unit-output pair, to one or more audience. Identify audiences with a blue sticky note.\n\n\nConstraints\n\nEvery audience should appear only once\nEvery unit should be connected to at least one audience\nEvery audience should be connected to at least one unit\nAudiences can be connected to more than one unit\nIf a unit produces more than one output to more than one audience, visually indicate which outputs go to which outputs\n\nQuestions for the array of audiences:\n\nWhen we look across our developing audiences, who is missing?\nDoes this suggest outputs that are missing from our repertoire?\nDoes this suggest missing work units we need to consider in the future?"

    "text": "1:05 – Activity #6 – Identifying Unit Inputs\n\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this activity is to define the essential prerequisites for each candidate System 1 unit to begin its autonomous work. This serves three primary goals\n\nTo solidify the boundaries of each System 1 unit be clearly defining its starting point\nTo create a concrete checklist of inputs that must be in place before work can be handed off to that unit, increasing transparency and predictability\nTo surface dependencies, bottlenecks, and potential resource conflicts that will provide the raw material for designing our System 2 (Coordination) functions in a later session\n\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat are the “starting blocks” for each unit? Think of this as mise en place for a recipe–you can’t start cooking efficiently until you have all the ingredients measured out on the counter. For each System 1 unit, what are the absolutely essential inputs, permissions, resources, and pieces of information that MUST be in place before that unit can begin its autonomous work?\nTry to be specific about what the unit might need. Broad classes of inputs might include things like Permissions & Access, Data & Information, or Scope & Direction.\n\n\nActivity\nOn a whiteboard populated with our candidate System 1 unit\n\nSilent, individual work (10 minutes)\n\nAdd orange sticky notes to any unit you like, representing necessary inputs to that unit.\nGenerate as many as you can without discussion or judgment.\nIf you see sticky notes from others that you agree with, add a comment or emoji.\n\n\n\nGroup discussion and refinement (25 minutes)\n\nMove through the whiteboard, unit-by-unit, discussing each input\nClarify: Is this truly a prerequsite, or is it something created or acquired during the unit’s work? We’ll remove anything that isn’t a true input.\nCluster: If sticky notes within a unit are similar, group them and consider a single label.\nRefine: Edit the language on the stickies to meet constraints and improve clarity.\n\n\n\nCross-system patterns (20 minutes)\n\nLook for patterns across the different units\nMark with a star any input that is required by more than one System 1 unit. These highlight a potential resource conflict or coordination need.\nMark with a red flame any input that the team agrees current has an unknown process, or is difficult, slow, or unreliable to obtain. This highlights known pain points and bottlenecks.\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nEach orange sticky note must be a tangible noun; it should be a noun or noun phrase, not a verb or process. What is the thing that the unit needs to have in hand before it can begin work?\nThe input must be a true prerequisite. If acquiring the item is part of the System 1 unit’s core work, it is not an input.\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nA more detailed process map of OEDA, highlighting some process dependencies. This will include an early list of flagged inputs which might represent shared resources (and thus potential conflicts) or known bottlenecks.

This will create a strategic roadmap that clarifies our immediate priorities, manages team workload, and provides a clear, defensible plan to present to our nascent advisory committee. It helps us distinguish between what in OEDA might be operational today versus what is aspirational for the future, near or distant.\n\n\nPrompt\nWe may not be able to formalize and build the support systems for all of our System 1 units at once. We need to prioritize, considering both importance and readiness. Can we sort our System 1 units into three categories: Now, Next, and Later?\n\nNow: These units are the most ready to go. We are confident in their basic processes and could support their needs. We feel comfortable presenting these to the OEDA Advisory Committee as a core service today or in the very near future.\nNext: These are high-priority units that–because of their outputs, audience, etc.–are crucial to our mission, but which need significant work. This may be securing inputs, refining processes, or dedicating resources. These are what we need to focus OEDA’s development efforts on in the near term.\nLater: These are units that are either less critical to our immediate strategic goals or require a great deal of work before they can be started.\n\n\n\nActivity\n\nGroup placement & discussion (20 minutes)\n\nDraw a 2 x 2 matrix on a whiteboard\nX axis: Readiness (“Needs significant work” to “Ready today”)\nY axis: Importance (“Lower strategic value” to “High strategic value”)\nCopy over the candidate unit sticky notes\n\nAs a group, we will interrogate each candidate OEDA unit\n\nConsidering this unit’s a) outputs and b) audiences, how high is its strategic importance to our teams core mission? The group’s rough consensus will determine the vertical position of the sticky note on the plane.\nConsidering the a) inputs we identified today and b) the state or need of standard operating procedures and other supports, how ready are we to operate this unit effectively today? Again, rough consensus will determine the horizontal position for the sticky note.\n\n\n\nDefine the zones (10 minutes)\nOnce the units are placed in the matrix, we will assign labels: Now, Next, Later\nIt could be that anything with high readiness is Now, and the other two quadrants become Next and Later based on their importance.\nOr it could be that anything with low importance is Later, and the other two quadrants are Next and Later based on their readiness."

Which one still feels most ambiguous or challenging to picture in practice?\nWe applied aspects of a very formal model-the Viable System Model–to our work, which is often creative, fluid, and conducted by a sole practitioner. What part of using that structured approach felt the most helpful or eye opening? What part felt the most awkward or difficult?\nWhen we discussed the inputs to or outputs from our work, what was the most surprising dependency or connection we uncoverwed that maybe we hadn’t explicitly acknowledged before?\nWhile there has been variation in ORRAI projects, it’s not uncommon for work to have been a “one-person-show” from start to finish. What are the biggest opportunities you see in a model of potential distinct units with clear hand-offs? What are the biggest risks or potential downsides we need to be mindful of as we go forward?\nFor our work to be truly autonomous in these units, we need to trust one another’s outputs.

Think about the general flow of work from initial idea or request, through the hands of one or more of our units, to a final product for a stakeholder. Where does the process get stuck? Where do units compete for resources?

    "text": "Monday, August 11 – 9:00-Noon\nTo design the team’s operational management system (System 3) by defining how we will monitor performance, allocate resources, create collaborations and common purpose, and establish a regular management rhythm to ensure we deliver on our objectives.\nSo far, we’ve introduced what we do in System 1, who we are in System 5, how we coordinate and keep momentum in System 2, and where we’re going in System 4. Today, we will talk about building the operational “command center” that runs the machine: System 3.\nSystem 2 provides the relatively passive tools for coordination–checklists, templates, etc. System 3 is the active, day-to-day management function in OEDA. System 3 is how we monitor our progress, allocate our time, and make decisions. System 3 helps ensure that our System 1 units are efficient and effective, that they are using the System 2 tools to reduce friction, that the work reflects the values from our System 5, and can be correct course and be responsive to intelligene we receive from System 4.\n\n\n\n09:00 – Debrief Day 2\n09:30 – Activity #1 - Brainstorm & align - Metrics\n10:30 – 15-minute break\n10:45 – Activity #2 - Brainstorm & align - Allocation of time and energy\n11:14 – Activity #3 - Brainstorm & align - OEDA’s operational cadence\nNoon – Break for lunch\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to leave with a clear, shared understanding of how we will manage our work over the next quarter or more, track our performance, and make operational decisions as a team."

    "text": "9:30 - Activity #1 - The OEDA Dashboard\n\nPurpose\nTo define a small set of measures that will allow OEDA to monitor the health and progress of its System 1 work units at a glance.\nI want to acknowledge that, historically, we have not used formal metrics to manage our work. We have one official metric–% of project time disaggregated by broad program areas across ODHS and OHA. It is not a well-designed metric and tells us almost nothing of value about OEDA’s mission.\nI think that the feeling that a single, inadequate metric is more frustrating than helpful is a reason why we’ve relied more on informal check-ins and conversations, and more recently narrative project updates in the tracker, to know what’s going and and how we’re doing. That informal path, where you can always come to me, or Kody, or Peter to talk about problems and success cannot be replaced by any kind of metric.\nHowever, as our work grows and differentiates, it will become very difficult for any one person to keep track of everything through conversation alone. This is where System 3 thinking comes in.\nThe purpose of developing a few key metrics is not to create a report card to judge our performance. A dashboard on a car doesn’t judge the driver. The speedometer, the fuel gauge, the engine temp–these are neutral, real-time signals to help the driver make better decisions. They can help the driver know when to slow down, when to refuel, or when to pull over and look under the hood. In our context, they should be conversation starters, not conclusions.\nMetrics can help us understand what is happening; our conversations can help us figure out why.\nWe’re going to brainstorm a few of these metrics that we believe are useful for spotting problems early, celebrating successes, and freeing up info about the team from the mind of a single person. I’m hoping we can spend less time guessing and more time in useful conversations about our work and processes.\n\n\nPrompt\nSystem 3 is about active intervention, when necessary. How does the OEDA system know when intervention is necessary?\n\nWhat are we trying to achieve?\nHow will we know when we have done that?\n\nUltimately, we’ll want just a handful of around 7 metrics to reflect the overall health of OEDA. Ideally, these are for operational, managerial, System 3 purposes. We should be able to use them to understand how we’re doing, identify the need for attention or change.\nWe shouldn’t worry, yet, about accountability metrics to external parties.\nThat said, we could consider being strategic with metrics. E.g. a count of inter-agency hypotheses tested will be slow incrementing–especially at first–and likely not helpful for day-to-day management. It’s not something that would likely be valuable in a monthly metric review for quite some time. But maybe it’s something to highlight at each Advisory Council meeting to try to motivate more sharing.\n\nWhat we might be trying to achieve\nOEDA was created to support “integration and analysis of client and customer service information across state agencies and programs … [and] provide coordination, consolidation, and clear accountability for that work.”\nIn our discussion of System 5, we have decided that we want our work to be:\n\nEthical\nUnderstandable, accessible, usable, and approachable\nRigorous and trustworthy\nInnovative\nRelevant and impactful\n\nWe discussed some kinds of relevance and impact which might include\n\ninforming decisions;\nimproving effectiveness, efficiency, and equity in service provision\ncreating conversations that heretofore did not exist\nimproving lives of workers and the Oregonians they serve.\n\nAnd we’ve decided that we want our processes to be:\n\nCollaborative\nConstructive\nCommunicative\nManaging expectations\nPlaying well with others\nProfessional & conscientious\n\nAnd, finally, we’ve decided on two lists of potential Now and Next System 1 units for OEDA:\nNow\n\nIdeation unit\nMeasurement unit\nAnalytics - General\nAnalytics - Exploratory\nAnalytics - Descriptive\nAnalytics - Hypothesis testing\nAnalytics - Evaluation\nAnalytics - Economics\n\nNext\n\nDUA unit\nOEDA enterprise outcomes unit\nOutreach unit\nExternal training & literacy unit\nPartnerships unit\nCOIN unit\nInfrastructure unit\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\nSetup\nOn a whiteboard include some spaces that represent our founding purpose, our values, our potential impacts, and the Now & Next System 1 units we identified.\n\n\nIndividual silent brainstorm (15 minutes)\nAdd potential metrics to any of the categories.\n\n\nAlign and refine (35 minutes)\n\nAsk clarifying questions about any of the proposed metrics\n\n\n\nSelections (10 minutes)\n\nWalk through each, one by one\nIs it safe enough to try? Does it threaten OEDA’s mission or values?\nIs it good enough for now? Is the likely juice worth the squeeze?\nFrom those which are, select 5-8 for proposed inclusion in a future dashboard\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nMetrics should be realistically measurable\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nA draft OEDA dashboard of some initial operational metrics"

    "text": "10:45 - Activity #2 - Allocating Our Energy\n\nPurpose\nTo create a clear, transparent, and fair model for allocating OEDA’s collective time and energy across different types of work.\n\n\nPrompt\nOur time is our most limited and valuable resource. Let’s talk about how we’re deploying it strategically between now and March 31 (end of 2026 Q1). We need to deliver on the work we have, but also need to ramp up to working with a governance council and develop our System 2 and System 4 tools. Let’s create a model for how we will intentionally allocate our energy.\n\n\nActivity\n\nSetup\nOn a whiteboard we’ll list out the following large divisions of work. These are largely the day-to-day, the emergency, and the day-to-day that Fariborz often talks of.\n\nAdvancing existing ORRAI work\nSystem 4 development: Working with informants, documents, & literature to create OEDA proposals\nOther System 4 tool development\nSystem 2 tool development\nUnplanned/reactive work\n\nFor each, draw a scale from 0-100 represent % of work time. Consider 100% to be the total number of hours that you have to contribute, outside of things like Workday entries, HR trainings, all staff meetings, vacation and other leave, etc. This is time that you could contribute to internal or external projects, collaboration, consultation, etc.\nAcross three different exercises, you’ll be\n\nPicking a stamp/emoji to represent your answers\nPlacing a stamp in each row of the array, representing the % of work time to spend on that topic\n\n\n\nPersonal preferences for the rest of 2025 (10 minutes)\n\nPlace your stamps at the % of time that you would prefer spending your time for the remainder of the year\nConsider the amount of existing work you might have, what you anticipate we might need to be doing to prepare ourselves for the OEDA Advisory Council, etc.\nWe’ll briefly discuss the pattern of responses as a team\n\n\n\nWhat OEDA should be doing for the rest of 2025 (10 minutes)\n\nPlace your stamps at the % of time that you think OEDA should be doing–averaged across all on the team–for the remainder of the year\nWe’ll briefly discuss the pattern of responses as a team\n\n\n\nWhat we should be doing in 2026 (10 minutes)\n\nFinally, indicate your percentages for what the team–again averaged across everyone–should be doing in 2026\nConsider that we’ll be working with the committee, might have at least OYA contacts, ODHS, and perhaps Medicaid data to work with, etc.\nWe’ll briefly discuss the pattern of responses as a team\n\n\n\n\nContraints\n\nIn each array, the total summing down the 5 or 6 items should roughly sum to 100%.\nUse the same stamp across each of the arrays\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nAn initial model allocating efforts in OEDA."

    "text": "11:15 - Activity #3 - OEDA’s Operational Cadence\n\nPurpose\nTo bring some of the System 3 concepts together to create a concrete schedule of recurring meetings, check-ins, emails, workgroup sessions, reviews of chats, etc.\n\n\nPrompt\nWhat is the minimal, effective rhythm of regular OEDA events–our operational cadence–that we need to run our system? How do we stay in sync without spending all our time in meetings?\n\nWhat info needs to flow, to whom, and how often?\nWhat are the key recurring decisions OEDA needs to make? Selecting ideas to propose as projects? Prioritizing project work? Allocating staff time? Getting assurance that work is good enough for now?\n\nWhere, when, and how does everyone on the team * Share new intelligence? * Ask for a System 1 unit to be spun up or receive a hand off? * Re-balance how they allocate their time? * Identify and resolve blockers\n\nSome goals\n\nDampening oscillation (System 2). How can we prevent problems from oscillating for days, weeks, months? When a researcher is stuck, how can the OEDA team know and mobilize to get them unstuck without a month passing? How can we prevent blockers from derailing a whole day of progress?\nOperationalization of management (System 3). This calendar is the operating manual for System 3–or at least a substantial part of it. It’s the structure by which OEDA and Jason as OEDA manager will perform key System 3 functions like monitoring performance, surfacing issues, allocating resources, and increasing harmony of purpose.\nCreating a pathway for strategy (System 4). System 4 intelligence should be able to influence day-to-day operations. How can we create a formal pathway for this? How can we create opportunities for the team to learn about trends, problems, and opportunities and ask “How should this discovery change our current priorities?”\nProtecting autonomy (System 1). Ideally, if OEDA staff know exactly when and where key decisions will be made and coordination will happen, this will reduce doubt about both a) when and from whom they can get support, and b) they are protected from ad hoc interruptions and “just checking in” messages and meetings from management, project management, and sponsors.\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\nSetup\nOn a whiteboard create calendars at different resolutions\n\nThings that happen one or two times per quarter\nThings that happen one or two times a month\nThings that happen one or two times a week\nThings that happen daily\n\n\n\nSilent, individual contributions (10 minutes)\n\nCopying and pasting the provided example card, add one or more regular activities–synchronous activities like stand-ups, check-ins, meetings, or asynchronous like tracker updates, email updates, etc.–to one or more of the calendars\n\n\n\nGroup alignment & refinement (35 minutes)\n\nAsk clarifying questions\nEnsure that suggested activities is well defined and similarly understood\nEnsure that suggested activities have identifies a small number of primary purposes\nEnsure that all key OEDA decisions have a venue\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nFor every meeting placed on the calendar, the team must agree on its single, primary purpose.\nAdditional purposes are okay.\nIf a meeting doesn’t have a clear purpose, it doesn’t go on the calendar.\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nA first draft OEDA calendar of our operational cadence. This is our new System 3 operating manual, and should show the simple, predictable rhythm to keep our system running smoothly."
