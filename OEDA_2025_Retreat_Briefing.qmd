## Purpose

OEDA met for three working days to do some strategic planning. We used Beer's [Viable System Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model) as an organizing structure.



## The Viable System Model

### Intro

The Viable System Model is a framework for diagnosing and designing organizations so they remain viable: adaptive, resilient, and capable of surviving in complex environments. The model identifies five core subsystems that must exist and function well for any organization (including a team like ours) to be viable. These subsystems exist within a larger environment, and the way that they communicate and balance one another is a key to long-term success.
