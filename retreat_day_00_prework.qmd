## Prework for Day 1, Activity #1 -- Roundtable: Imagining Our Future

### Purpose

These quick, initial talks will get everyone coming off camera and talking to the team. They will help us begin to think about OEDA activities that our System 1 units will do, and about the kinds of complexities and challenges that Systems 2, 3, 4, and 5 should be designed to help with.

The goal here is not to create an agenda, but to hear from one another about the kind of work that could be possible. I am hoping we start to think about what we and others might need to do to create the kinds of conditions where that work is possible.

### Prompt

*Imagine that OEDA was adequately setup to perform our mandate: integrating and analyzing cross-agency client and customer service data. Describe a kind of project that only OEDA could do in state government. Make it one that you would like to work on, preferably with others on or off of the team.*

-   What are some of the activities that you would contribute?
-   What would you need others to do?
-   What would make the work complex?
-   Who would find value in this work?
-   What could the impact of the work be?

This project does not have to be feasible in OEDA's current state.

### Activity

Each OEDA individual contributor will talk for two or three minutes on a hypothetical future OEDA project.
