## Prework for Day 1, Activity #1 -- Roundtable: Imagining Our Future

### Purpose

These quick, initial talks will get everyone coming off camera and talking to the team. They will help us begin to think about OEDA activities that our System 1 units will do, and about the kinds of complexities and challenges that Systems 2, 3, 4, and 5 should be designed to help with.

The goal here is not to create an agenda, but to hear from one another about the kind of work that could be possible. I am hoping that this will get us thinking about what we might need to do, and what we might need to ask others to do, to create the conditions where that work is possible.

### Prompt

*Imagine that OEDA was adequately setup to perform our mandate: integrating and analyzing cross-agency client and customer service data. Describe a kind of project that only OEDA could do in state government. Make it one that you would like to work on, preferably with others on or off of the team.*

-   What are some of the activities that you would contribute?
-   What would you need others to do?
-   What would make the work complex?
-   Who would find value in this work?
-   What could the impact of the work be?

This project does not have to be feasible in OEDA's current state. This may never be a project that OEDA pursues; we are just trying to get imaginations going and introduce a few of the ideas we'll be working with throughout the retreat.

### Pre-work activity

Write out a brief narrative or some notes so that, during the retreat you can share your hypothetical project with OEDA in about two or three minutes. 


## Prework for Day 1, Activity #2 -- Brainstorming OEDA Actions

### Purpose

OEDA does not have defined System 1 units, defaulting instead to individual employees and individual projects. While System 1 is defined at the level of *units*, and not activities or processes, one route to defining units is to consider the typical work of an organization and then group those activities into functional units. That is what we will be trying to do.

In this pre-work activity, we will list the activities that the OEDA team, currently constituted, can or could engage in to bring value to cross-agency stakeholders.

### Prompt

*What are OEDA's core value-creating activities? What could those be in OEDA's future? What should they be?*

### Background material

System 1 activities should fit within the DAS classification for OEDA positions. I have provided some [background on OEDA position types](retreat_support_OEDA_positions.qmd) to help with this alignment as you brainstorm.

### Pre-work activity

Populate a whiteboard with post-it notes reflecting the value-creating activities of OEDA, those in which our staff receive some input and act on it, adding value which is ultimately realized in a deliverable to a stakeholder.

1.  Open the [Prework - OEDA Actions whiteboard](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/95de633a-083e-42f5-b444-a4295d8e9314/_djb2_msteams_prefix_2138725456?context=%7B%22chatId%22%3A%2219%3Ameeting_NGI5MmE1ZjAtOWQzNS00MjNlLThkMTgtZGIzZDYxYzUxOTYx%40thread.v2%22%2C%22contextType%22%3A%22chat%22%7D&tenantId=658e63e8-8d39-499c-8f48-13adc9452f4c)
2.  Find the area labeled with your name
3.  Add multiple **yellow** [sticky-notes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-notes-and-note-grids-in-whiteboard-6e29d215-a3e0-431b-8ad4-6076fb444daf), one for each action you brainstorm
4.  Sticky notes should satisfy the constraints listed below

### Constraints

-   Each card should be a [**transitive verb**](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parts-of-speech/transitive-verbs/) and a [**direct object**](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parts-of-speech/direct-object/)
    -   The direct object should relate either to
        -   The inputs to the activity (e.g. *analyze data*)
        -   Or to the outputs from the activity (e.g. *create a slide deck*)
- Each card should be **unique**, appearing just once across the entire whiteboard (your section and those of everyone else)
-   Include activities that contribute to **products**; don't include HR training, Workday entry, etc.
-   Activities should **represent the breadth OEDA positions,** based on their general classifications
-   Include activities only for **positions managed by the OEDA manager**; exclude OEDA management, ORRAI leadership, and the data warehouse and reporting positions that OEDA funds

To keep cards unique, you might consider including a modifier/adjective to add specificity to the object. You could freely add one to your card; you might add a note to someone else's card for them to consider a modifer. E.g. rather than a card for "analyze data", you might distinguish between "analyze survey data", "analyze evaluation data", "analyze interview data", or "analyze economic data."


### Deliverable

A list of activities that OEDA staff or teams of staff can perform independently, are within the scope of DAS classifications for RA3, ECON3, and ISS7 positions, and which create value for stakeholders.
