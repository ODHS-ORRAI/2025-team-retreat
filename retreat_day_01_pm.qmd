## Intro to Day 1, Afternoon: Our Purpose

Tuesday, August 5 -- 2:45-4:55

We shift from the particulars of the day-to-day work of research in OEDA (System 1) to the highest level of the Viable System Model: System 5. This system is about identity, purpose, and values.

System 5 should be maintained and supported by ORRAI leadership, agency leadership, and our Advisory Council. But while our committee is still nascent, we have the opportunity to define our identity, rather than having it identified for us. This afternoon's work will directly inform our briefs to Peter, Liesl, and the Advisory Council, and should help set our mission, vision, and values.

### Brief agenda

- 02:45 -- Brainstorm & Align: The Qualities of What We Make
- 03:10 -- Brainstorm & Align: The Qualities of How We Work
- 03:35 -- 5-minute Break
- 03:40 -- Brainstorm & Align: The Impact We Want to Create
- 04:05 -- Brainstorm & Align: Connecting Values to Impact
- 04:40 -- End Day 1

### Day 1, Afternoon Deliverables

A values-to-impact map. This is the first draft of a visual artifact that demonstrates how OEDA's daily values contribute to our ultimate purpose. This will inform briefings to our director, agency leadership, and the nascent OEDA Advisory Council. This map can help drive high-level value statements, but could also be the seed of practical tools, like a rubric for evaluating which proposals become part of our portfolio.

## 2:45 -- Activity #1 -- Qualities of What We Make

<!-- 

* Rigor and trustworthiness
Rigorous, thorough, unbiased/objective, verifiable/defensible, accurate

* Clarity and usability
Clear, lucid, accessible, concise, well-structured, organized, insightful

* Relevant and impactful
Actionable, relevant, timely, impactful, consequential, authoritative, thought-provoking

-->

### Purpose

We will identify and align on the essential characteristics that should define what we create for our stakeholders. This may help create a shared standard of quality and a common language for describing the things we create.

### Prompt

*Imagine a key stakeholder--a legislator, an agency head, a program manager--or one of your OEDA peers has just finished reading one of your reports or using one of your tools. They turn to a colleague and say "This work is so ____". What adjectives would we want them to use?*

### Activity

#### Silent Individual Brainstorming (5 minutes)

Team members silently add sticky notes with single adjectives to the [Qualities of What We Create whiteboard](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/95de633a-083e-42f5-b444-a4295d8e9314/_djb2_msteams_prefix_2247411050?context=%7B%22chatId%22%3A%2219%3Ameeting_NGI5MmE1ZjAtOWQzNS00MjNlLThkMTgtZGIzZDYxYzUxOTYx%40thread.v2%22%2C%22contextType%22%3A%22chat%22%7D&tenantId=658e63e8-8d39-499c-8f48-13adc9452f4c). It's a brainstorm: strive for quantity over quality!

#### Alignment & refinement (15 minutes)

We will consider each adjective, one at a time. For each, we will determine whether it should sit next to an adjective that we've already considered, or should (for now) sit alone. We may have to split and regroup as we go!

#### Labeling (5 minutes)

For each group of adjectives, assign a good-enough-for-now label that reflects the theme of that group.

### Constraints

- Each sticky note should be an *adjective* or short adjectival phrase (e.g. "data-rich")
- Focus on the artifact. Each sticky should be something that could describe a product, deliverable, or output; *processes* and *working relationships* are the next activity

### Deliverable

A set of (perhaps 3-5) core themes, each supported by a cluster of descriptive adjectives, that define OEDA's shared vision for the qualities of its products.


## 3:10 -- Activity #2 -- Qualities of How We Work

### Purpose

To define the experience of working with OEDA. This can help establish our professional ethos and set internal expectations for how we engage with partners, stakeholders, and each other.

### Prompt

*Imagine the same stakeholder or peer describing the __experience__ of a project with you. They say "Working with this team is ..." What adjectives would you like to hear them using to describe our processes, collaboration, communication, and partnership?*

### Activity

#### Silent Individual Brainstorming (5 minutes)

Team members silently add sticky notes with single adjectives to the [Qualities of How We Work whiteboard](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/95de633a-083e-42f5-b444-a4295d8e9314/_djb2_msteams_prefix_1578114249?context=%7B%22chatId%22%3A%2219%3Ameeting_NGI5MmE1ZjAtOWQzNS00MjNlLThkMTgtZGIzZDYxYzUxOTYx%40thread.v2%22%2C%22contextType%22%3A%22chat%22%7D&tenantId=658e63e8-8d39-499c-8f48-13adc9452f4c).

#### Alignment & refinement (15 minutes)

As before, we will consider each adjective, one at a time, determining whether it should sit next to an adjective that we've already considered, or should (for now) sit alone.

#### Labeling (5 minutes)

For each group of adjectives, assign a good-enough-for-now label that reflects the theme of that group.

### Constraints

- Each sticky note should be an *adjective* or short adjectival phrase
- Focus on the experience. Each sticky should be something about processes, procedures, communication, collaboration - not the products.

### Deliverable

A set of 3-5 core themes--again each supported by a cluster of descriptive adjectives--that define our shared vision for our collaborative process, for how we work with one another and our stakeholders.
products.

## 3:35 -- 5-minute break

## 3:40 -- Activity #3 - The Impact We Want to Create

### Purpose

To articulate the meaningful, real-world, outcome-related changes to which our work should contribute. We will move beyond our outputs to outcomes: change for agency processes and policies, change for Oregonian's experiences, and so on. These impacts can help form the core of OEDA's purpose.

### Prompt

*We've defined the qualities of our work and of our process. Here, we ask the most important question: __So what?__ If we do all this high-quality, collaborative work, what will change in the world? What impact will it have? Months and years down the road, how would we complete the sentence: "Because of our work..."?*

### Activity

#### Group brainstorm & discussion (25 minutes)

1.    What decisions will be better informed?
2.    Whose lives will be improved?
3.    What state systems will become more efficient? More effective? More equitable?
4.    What conversations will be started that weren't happening before?

We can use the [OEDA Impacts whiteboard](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/95de633a-083e-42f5-b444-a4295d8e9314/_djb2_msteams_prefix_527112126?context=%7B%22chatId%22%3A%2219%3Ameeting_NGI5MmE1ZjAtOWQzNS00MjNlLThkMTgtZGIzZDYxYzUxOTYx%40thread.v2%22%2C%22contextType%22%3A%22chat%22%7D&tenantId=658e63e8-8d39-499c-8f48-13adc9452f4c).

#### Constraints

- Focus on external change. Our statements should describe effects outside of our team: in policy, operations, public understanding, etc.
- Consider using active verbs, framing impacts as actions or changes. E.g. rather than "Better information for policy makers" maybe something like "Policy makers make evidence-based budget decisions."

#### Deliverable

This activity is not setting an agenda. We will return to potential impacts many times in the future. For now, this will be a messy, anything-goes, first attempt at naming some of the things that OEDA could try to change in the future of Oregon state government.

## 4:05 -- Activity #4 -- Connecting Values to Impact

### Purpose

In this capstone activity, we will synthesize the afternoon's work by explicitly linking our values -- the qualities of our products and process (Activities #1 & #2, above) -- to our purpose -- the kinds of impacts we want to create (Activity #3).

### Prompt

*How do the things we value in our work and in our process directly enable the impacts we want to see in the world? Let's connect our how and our why.*

### Activity

We will create a table with three columns and several rows. Cells in the leftmost column will contain one or more qualities. Qualities can be repeated in different rows. Cells in the rightmost column will contain one or more impacts.

In the middle, we will identify the *mechanism(s)* through which those values can help bring about the impacts we want to see.

For instance, if one of our product qualities relates to ease of understanding and highlighting key takeaways, and one of our impacts is "program managers can use our evidence to adapt their daily practices and improve services", the *how* in the middle column might be "because we translate complex statistical findings into accessible language and visuals, allowing non-technical audiences to grasp the core message and its implications for their work."

<!-- Examples

## Trustworthiness
Value / Quality:
Rigorous & Defensible. We value work that is methodologically sound, thorough, and can withstand critical scrutiny.

Mechanism / Contribution (The "How"):
...because when leaders and their staff know that our conclusions are built on an unbiased and verifiable evidence base, they don't have to second-guess the data's integrity.

Impact:
...so that state leaders can confidently base high-stakes policy and budget decisions on our findings.

(This trio connects the internal value of methodological rigor directly to the external impact of confident, evidence-based leadership.)

# Partnership
Value / Quality:
Collaborative & Responsive. We value a process where we act as true partners, listening to our stakeholders' needs and adapting to them.

Mechanism / Contribution (The "How"):
...because when partner agencies feel respected, heard, and included in the process, they become more willing to share sensitive data and co-invest their own resources in joint solutions.

Impact:
...so that siloed state agencies begin to tackle complex, cross-cutting problems (like poverty or health equity) together.

(This trio connects the interpersonal value of good partnership directly to the strategic impact of breaking down government silos.)

# Clarity
Value / Quality:
Clear & Insightful. We value products that are not just data-rich, but are also easy to understand and clearly highlight the most important takeaways.

Mechanism / Contribution (The "How"):
...because we translate complex statistical findings into accessible language and visuals, allowing non-technical audiences to grasp the core message and its implications for their work.

Impact:
...so that program managers on the front lines can understand and use our evidence to adapt their daily practices, improving services for Oregonians.

(This trio connects the communication value of clarity directly to the ground-level impact of improving actual service delivery.)

# Proactivity
Value / Quality:
Forward-Looking & Proactive. We value the ability to look over the horizon, anticipating future questions and identifying emerging trends before they become critical issues.

Mechanism / Contribution (The "How"):
...because we independently scan for and analyze developing trends, providing leaders with early warnings and the necessary runway to plan and intervene before a situation demands reactive crisis management.

Impact:
...so that the state can shift from constantly reacting to problems to designing proactive, preventative strategies.

(This trio connects the value of strategic foresight directly to the high-level government impact of moving from a reactive to a proactive posture.)


# Impartiality
Value / Quality:
Objective & Impartial. We value our role as a neutral, non-partisan source of information, committed to presenting facts without bias or agenda.

Mechanism / Contribution (The "How"):
...because all parties, regardless of their position, can trust us to be an honest broker of information, creating a shared, factual foundation that can be used to ground difficult conversations.

Impact:
...so that politically contentious debates can become more productive and less polarized, leading to more durable policy solutions.

(This trio connects the civic value of impartiality directly to the practical impact of improving the quality and reducing the friction of political discourse.)

# Holistic

Example 6: The Holistic Trio
Value / Quality:
Integrative & Holistic. We value our unique, cross-agency mandate, striving always to connect disparate data to see the whole picture.

Mechanism / Contribution (The "How"):
...because by linking data from health, housing, and employment, we reveal how a person's journey interacts with multiple systems, making the invisible, interconnected nature of their challenges visible to policymakers.

Impact:
...so that state programs can be designed and funded around the needs of the whole person, rather than addressing complex problems in isolated fragments.

(This trio connects the team's unique structural value (cross-agency view) directly to the profound service-delivery impact of treating people holistically.)

-->

#### Group mapping & discussion (25 minutes)

For each quality, we will ask

- "Which of our desired impacts does this quality help us achieve?"
- "And *how* does it do that?" Don't get caught up in wordsmithing at this point. Simple sketches of ideas are fine.

I've created a simple [Word document](https://dhsoha.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ODHS-ORRAI-OEDA/Shared%20Documents/OEDA%20Governance/Document.docx?d=w22526cfb61a147688043d3ee3005f64d&csf=1&web=1&e=iuRQV0) to house this activity.

#### Constraints

- Each connection between value(s) and impact should (eventually) be explainable and clear. If the link is weak, we shouldn't force it today.

#### Deliverable

A values-to-impact map. This is the first draft of a visual artifact that demonstrates how OEDA's daily values contribute to our ultimate purpose. This map can help drive high-level value statements, but could also be the seed of practical tools, like a rubric for evaluating which proposals become part of our portfolio.

### 4:40 -- End for the day

A very long Day 1 is done!
